const deliverables = [
  { title: 'Investor-Ready Architecture', description: 'Service boundaries, typed contracts, and domain models documented in detail. When due diligence asks "what does the architecture look like," you hand them a blueprint, not a whiteboard sketch.' },
  { title: 'Production Microservices', description: 'TypeScript with strict mode. CQRS and event sourcing. Zero infrastructure code in your business logic. Built to scale from ten users to ten thousand without rearchitecting.' },
  { title: 'Security From Day One', description: 'Two-layer authorization on every handler. Permission-based gateway access plus business-rule policy enforcement. Not bolted on later. Built in from the first line of code.' },
  { title: 'Comprehensive Test Suites', description: '90%+ coverage enforced on every service. When your technical due diligence asks about testing, you show them the coverage reports, not a promise.' },
  { title: 'Full Observability', description: 'Distributed tracing, metrics, and dashboards. When something breaks at 2 AM (it will), you see exactly where, exactly why, and exactly what happened before and after.' },
  { title: 'Deployment-Ready Infrastructure', description: 'Containerized services, infrastructure configuration, deployment documentation. Ready for AWS, GCP, Azure, or your own servers. No vendor lock-in.' },
  { title: 'Onboarding-Ready Documentation', description: 'Architecture docs, service guides, and code that follows strict conventions. Your first engineering hire reads the docs, not the Slack history.' },
