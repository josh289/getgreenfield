  {
    question: 'Do you take equity?',
    answer: 'No. We charge a fixed fee for a defined scope of work. You keep your cap table clean. We keep our incentives aligned with delivering quality work on time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns the code?',
    answer: 'You do. Completely. Source code, architecture documentation, deployment configurations, test suites -- all of it. No retained licenses, no proprietary dependencies, no lock-in. It is your company\'s IP from the moment we deliver.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if we do not have a codebase yet -- just a spec?',
    answer: 'That works. We can build from a technical specification, wireframes, or a detailed product description. The discovery phase is designed to take whatever you have and turn it into an executable architecture blueprint.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we make changes after the blueprint is approved?',
    answer: 'Yes, within reason. Minor scope adjustments during the build phase are normal and expected. Significant changes are scoped as additional work with clear timelines and costs. The blueprint review exists to minimize this -- we get it right upfront.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens when we hire our own engineers?',
    answer: 'They inherit a clean codebase with strict conventions, comprehensive documentation, and 90%+ test coverage. We have seen engineers onboard to our delivered systems in days, not weeks. The architecture is designed to be readable and extensible by any competent TypeScript developer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide ongoing support?',
    answer: 'We offer post-delivery support packages for the transition period. But the goal is full independence. We build systems that your team can maintain and extend without us. If you need additional services built later, we are happy to do another engagement.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does this compare to hiring a technical co-founder?',
    answer: 'A technical co-founder costs equity, takes months to find, and may or may not build production-quality systems. We cost a fixed fee, start immediately, and deliver a system with enforced quality standards. We are not a co-founder replacement -- we are a production infrastructure solution that buys you time to find the right long-term technical leader.',
  },
