      Hiring a platform team takes months to ramp and costs more per year than most companies budget for the entire project. Contractors write code that nobody can maintain. Internal teams are already stretched — backlog growing, deadlines slipping, tech debt compounding.

    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      The gap between a working prototype and production-grade software is massive. It demands distributed architecture, typed contracts, authorization, observability, testing, deployment — and the rare engineers who can build all of it. Most companies either overpay or underdeliver.

      There is a better way. Treat software like manufacturing. Standardize the process. Enforce quality at every step. Deliver predictable results.
