      AI agents are writing more code than ever before. Engineers are prompting faster than they can review. Multiple agents rewrite the same files, step on each other's work, and produce mountains of output that no human can meaningfully verify. The volume is up. The quality isn't.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      The processes that worked before AI don't work anymore. How do you run a sprint when each developer can leverage agents to write thousands of lines of code per day? How do you do code review? How do you maintain architecture when the codebase changes faster than anyone can read it?
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      Everyone is waiting for models with better memory and larger context windows. They only need those things because their architecture was never designed for the constraints of the models. The AI works. Your architecture and processes don't.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      A handful of teams have figured this out. They're shipping at a pace that makes their competitors look like they're standing still. Everyone else is either struggling to manage the flood of AI-generated code or barely scratching the surface of what's possible.
    </p>

      The gap is widening every week. We built the system that closes it: structured agents, enforced quality gates, and predictable production output.
