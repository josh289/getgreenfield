      AI agents are writing more code than ever before. Engineers are prompting faster than they can review. Multiple agents rewrite the same files, step on each other's work, and produce mountains of output that no human can meaningfully verify. The volume is up. The quality isn't.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      The processes that worked before AI don't work anymore. How do you run a sprint when each developer can leverage agents to write thousands of lines of code per day? How do you do code review? How do you maintain architecture when the codebase changes faster than anyone can read it?
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      Everyone is waiting for models with better memory and larger context windows. They only need those things because their architecture was never designed for the constraints of the models. The bottleneck was never the AI. It's the system around it.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      Only a small percentage of companies have figured this out. The rest are drowning in generated code that doesn't compose, doesn't test well, and doesn't survive contact with production.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      The organizations that master this technology are shipping at a pace that makes their competitors look standing still. The gap is only getting wider. We built the system that closes it: structured agents, enforced quality gates, and predictable production output.
