      The monolith was supposed to be temporary. The prototype was supposed to get replaced. The "quick fix" from three years ago is now load-bearing infrastructure. Your team is spending more time maintaining legacy systems than building new features.

    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      You have tried hiring. The market for senior platform engineers is brutal — six-month searches, six-figure compensation packages, and even when you land someone, they spend their first quarter learning the codebase. You have tried contractors. The code they wrote is technically functional and practically unmaintainable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      Meanwhile, the backlog grows. Deadlines slip. The board asks why delivery is slow. Your best engineers are burning out on infrastructure work when they should be solving business problems.

      This is the brownfield trap. And there is a way out.
