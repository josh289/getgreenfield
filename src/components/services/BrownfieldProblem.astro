      Every organization wants to move faster with AI. The models are ready. The tooling is ready. But your codebase isn't. The monolith that was supposed to be temporary, the prototype that was never replaced, the quick fix from three years ago that's now load-bearing infrastructure. None of it was built for AI to work with.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      AI agents need clear service boundaries, typed contracts, and isolated domains to be effective. They can't reason about a tangled monolith any better than your team can. Tech debt confuses your engineers. It makes your AI agents hallucinate.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      So the organizations seeing real gains from AI aren't the ones with the best prompts. They're the ones that modernized their architecture and methodology first. The rest are stuck waiting for a smarter model to save them from a codebase that was never designed for this.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text font-medium leading-relaxed">
      We build the foundation that's ready for today's agents and whatever comes next.
