    title: 'CQRS + Event Sourcing',
    content: 'Commands and queries are separated at the architecture level. Every state change is an immutable event stored in PostgreSQL. You get a complete audit trail, temporal queries, and the ability to rebuild any projection from the event stream. Read models are eventually consistent, projected from the event store through dedicated event handlers.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Type-Safe Contract System',
    content: 'Services declare typed input/output contracts using TypeScript const types. Contracts are validated at compile time — not runtime. No magic strings. When a service changes its contract, every consumer knows at compile time. Validation decorators define runtime schemas without build-time code generation.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Two-Layer Authorization',
    content: 'Layer 1: Permission-based access control at the API gateway. Every route maps to a required permission. No permission, no access. Layer 2: Business-rule policy enforcement inside each handler. The data itself determines what is allowed. Both layers are mandatory, tested, and audited.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Zero Infrastructure Code',
    content: 'Services contain only domain logic. A service starts with one line: BaseService.start({ name: \'my-service\', version: \'1.0.0\' }). RabbitMQ messaging, PostgreSQL persistence, Redis caching, OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics — all provided by the platform. Handlers are auto-discovered by folder convention: /commands/, /queries/, /events/.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Observability Built In',
    content: 'OpenTelemetry instrumentation on every service. Jaeger for distributed tracing. Prometheus for metrics collection. Grafana for dashboards. Every request is traceable across service boundaries. Every event is logged. Every error has context.',
