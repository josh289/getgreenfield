      Your prototype proves the idea. Investors are interested. Early users are asking for access. But the codebase that powered the demo will not survive real traffic, real data, and real security requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      You need microservices architecture. Typed contracts between services. Authorization on every endpoint. Test coverage that gives your investors confidence. Observability so you can actually debug production issues at 2 AM. Deployment infrastructure that scales.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      You also need it in weeks, not quarters. You are burning runway. Every month spent rebuilding is a month not spent on growth, sales, and product.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
      Hiring a platform team to solve this takes months to assemble and costs more per year than most seed rounds can absorb. You do not have months. You have a prototype, a deadline, and the need to ship production-grade software yesterday.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text font-medium leading-relaxed">
      That is exactly what we build.
