      Greenfield Labs exists to make production software manufacturing predictable, affordable, and repeatable. Every company that builds software should be able to get from prototype to production without hiring a platform team, burning a year of runway, or accepting "it works on my machine" as a quality standard.

      We are building the infrastructure that makes this possible — and the company that operates it until your team is ready to run it themselves.
