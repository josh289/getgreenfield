        Greenfield Labs started with a question: why is building production software so unpredictable?
      </p>
      <p>
        Every company that builds software faces the same set of problems. Service boundaries need to be defined. Contracts need to be typed and validated. Authorization needs to work on every endpoint. Tests need to cover the code that matters. Tracing needs to show what happened when something breaks. Deployment needs to be repeatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        These problems are solved problems. The patterns exist. The tools exist. But every team solves them from scratch, in a different way, with different quality standards. The result is what the industry accepts as normal: unpredictable timelines, inconsistent quality, and infrastructure code that drowns out business logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manufacturing solved this problem in every other industry a century ago. Standardize the process. Enforce quality at every step. Build from blueprints, not from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greenfield Labs applies the manufacturing model to software. We built a platform — Greenfield — that standardizes how production microservices are constructed. We built an assembly line — Evergreen — that automates quality enforcement. And we run the factory ourselves, delivering production-ready systems at predictable cost and timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The insight was simple. The execution required building the entire manufacturing stack from the ground up. That is what we did.
