      Today, Greenfield Labs runs the factory. We take your codebase, produce the blueprints, and Evergreen builds the services. Your team receives the output.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Tomorrow, Evergreen is the tool your engineers operate directly. The same assembly line. The same quality gates. The same predictable output. But run by your team, on your schedule, inside your infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Evergreen combines AI-assisted code generation with deterministic quality enforcement. It does not generate code and hope for the best. It generates code, validates it against typed contracts, runs it through quality gates, and either passes it or rejects it. The output is guaranteed to meet the same standard we enforce in every engagement.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ev-text-secondary text-lg leading-relaxed">
      The goal is not perpetual dependency on Greenfield Labs. The goal is building your organization's capacity to manufacture software at scale.
