  { title: 'Blueprint-to-Service Generation', description: 'Define your architecture blueprint and typed contracts. Evergreen generates production microservices with CQRS, event sourcing, and zero infrastructure code.' },
  { title: 'Automated Test Generation', description: 'Every generated handler gets corresponding test suites. Unit tests, integration tests, and contract validation tests, generated and executed automatically.' },
  { title: 'Contract Validation', description: 'Typed input/output contracts are enforced at compile time. When a service changes its contract, every consumer is validated before anything ships.' },
  { title: 'Authorization Scaffolding', description: 'Two-layer authorization generated for every handler. Permission-based gateway access and business-rule policy enforcement, configured, not coded.' },
  { title: 'Quality Gate Pipeline', description: 'The same gates we enforce in every engagement: 90%+ coverage, strict TypeScript compilation, contract validation, authorization verification, tracing validation. Automated. Non-negotiable.' },
  { title: 'Service Composition', description: 'Build new services that integrate with existing ones through the contract system. Evergreen understands your service topology and generates the correct integration points.' },
