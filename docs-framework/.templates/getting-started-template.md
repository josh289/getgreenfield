GETTING STARTED TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

This template is for onboarding documentation that helps new users get up and running quickly.
Use this template when creating guides that:
- Install or set up the platform/tools
- Provide first-time user experiences
- Establish foundational knowledge
- Get users to their first "win" quickly

STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
1. Keep it concise - users want to get started fast
2. Provide clear, linear steps
3. Include verification steps so users know they succeeded
4. Link to deeper documentation for advanced topics
5. Focus on the happy path first

FRONTMATTER TIPS:
- title: Action-oriented (e.g., "Getting Started with Event Sourcing")
- description: What will the user accomplish?
- tags: Add relevant technology tags (e.g., "docker", "typescript", "rabbitmq")
- difficulty: Most getting-started docs should be "beginner"
- estimated_time: Be realistic - better to over-estimate
- prerequisites: List anything users need before starting
